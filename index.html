        There have been huge strides in the space of HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention since the epidemic initially took hold in the US in the late twentieth century. Today, as various strategic eradication plans - such as Ending the Epidemic in NYC - posit, undetectable means untransmittable. There are pre-exposure-prophylaxis drugs such as that of Truvada (colloquially known PreP), which HIV-negative individuals can take to prevent transmission from a partner who is positive. Yet, the disease remains a real challenge, particularly among gay men of color.

        The below map leverages data from NYC's open data portal to illustrate how the rate of new diagnoses (for males, given they comprise the majority of cases) has shifted over time, as well the racial disparities that persist. Use the slider to select a given year and the dropdown menu to select all races or filter for a given race. Hover over a particular neighborhood and note that the jitter plot will draw a line where the particular neighborhood and race combination fits into the overall distribution of new diagnosis rates. Note that a report of zero diagnoses (indicated as the color white) connotes missing information, annd the white space in Manhattan is Central Park, which does not have inhabitants.
