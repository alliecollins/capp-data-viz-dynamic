        There have been huge strides in the space of HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention since the epidemic initially took hold in the US in the late twentieth century. Today, as various strategic eradication plans - such as Ending the Epidemic in NYC - posit, undetectable means untransmittable. There are pre-exposure-prophylaxis drugs such as that of Truvada (colloquially known PreP), which HIV-negative individuals can take to prevent transmission from a partner who is positive. Yet, the disease remains a real challenge, particularly among gay men of color.

        The below map leverages data from NYC's open data portal to illustrate how the rate of new diagnoses has shifted over time, as well the racial disparities that persist. Use the slider to select a given year and the box to the right to select all races or filter for a given rate. The jitter plot will show you where the particular neighborhood and race combination fits into the overall distribution of new diagnoses.
