Notes on data:

I have uploaded the data as a geojson file, which I created from two files I acquired through the NYC data portal. A link to a colab notebook with this code can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AxzMh7srVphfMrfSRugWoppdoQHLpl_Z

The original source data can be found at: (1) NYC's annual HIV-AIDS report https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dohmh-hiv-aids-annual-report; (2) shapefile for mapping the health neighborhoods https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/health-tools/maps-gis-data-files-for-download.page
